# (Instructions for using the live site and its features coming soon)



# Development Contributors:

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node
* NPM

### Installing
* Clone repo
* Navigate to the root directory in your terminal and type 'npm install'
* Once that's finished, type 'npm run build' 
* Include the .env file:

### .env
Expects a .env file in root directory with a PORT variable set to your choice of port. If you're unsure what that means:
* Save a new blank file that is specifically named '.env'  (without the quotes), and save it at the very top level of this project, the same place where this very README exists (that's the root directory)
* Inside that file, type 'PORT=8000' (without the quotes!)
* Save the file
* That's it!

### Running locally
* Navigate to root directory in your terminal
* Make sure you have an active build (you'll see a /build folder in your directory). If it's your first time and you just cloned the repo, you won't have that. Not to worry! Just type 'npm run build' into your terminal
* Once you have the active build, type 'npm start'
* Alternatively, you can type 'npm devstart' to run with nodemon for easier changes

### Running the tests

* Navigate to root directory in your terminal and type 'npm run test'
